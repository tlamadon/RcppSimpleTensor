\title{This function generates another function that represents the tensor
descirbed in the only argument.}
\usage{
tensorFunction(expr, name = NULL, cache = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{tensor expression}

\item{name}{name to be associated with the tensor. The name is used to store the binary file
and the link to the object in a global list. Note that conflicts can happen if several packages
use identical names. If no name is provided a hash from the expression is computed.}

\item{cache}{whether you want the function to look for a cached version of the tensor.
RcppSimpleTensor will look in the hidden .tensor folder in the working directory for
a previously compiled binray for that particular tensor.}

\item{verbose}{prints information about the compilation if any as well as the generated
source code}
}
\description{
The function interprets the tensor expression, generates C++ code
for it, compiles the code, links the compiled code, and returns a 
a R function that wraps the C++ tensor
